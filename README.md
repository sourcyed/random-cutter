## Getting Started

### How to use the program

  You can download and run the program from the "Releases" tab of this repository or you can execute the "yed_random_cutter.py" file with Python3.

* First you choose the source video (the video which the clips will be taken from).
* Then you choose the background music (this will be added to the background of your new video).
* Then you choose the save location (the new video will be saved to this location).
* After that you set what length you want the new video to have.
* Then you set the cut length (the length of the clips).

* After hitting the "Cut" button your new video will be created.


### How to edit the code

  If you want to edit the source code of the program you will need Python 3.x and the listed modules:

* OpenCV for cutting and videos.
* MoviePy for adding background music.
* PyQt5 for the GUI.
